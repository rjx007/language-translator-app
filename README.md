Language Translator Web Application
This repository hosts a modern and intuitive Language Translator Web Application designed to break down communication barriers. Built with a responsive frontend using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this application provides seamless text translation across 20 important global languages. It integrates with the powerful Gemini API for accurate translations and enhances user experience with practical features like text-to-speech (TTS) functionality and one-click clipboard copying. This project showcases robust frontend development, API integration, and a commitment to a clean, user-friendly interface.

Technologies Used:

[Frontend Development]

1)HTML5: For the fundamental structure and content of the web page.

2)CSS3: For styling the application, including custom styles for buttons and scrollbars.

3)Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used extensively for rapid and responsive UI development, handling layout, spacing, typography, and component styling.

4)Vanilla JavaScript: All interactive logic, API calls, and DOM manipulation are handled directly with plain JavaScript, without relying on additional frontend frameworks.

[API Integration]

1)Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash model): The core translation functionality is powered by direct API calls to Google's Gemini model for natural language processing and translation.

[External Libraries/CDNs]

1)Font Awesome: Used for scalable vector icons (like the language, copy, and volume-up symbols) to enhance the visual appeal of buttons.

2)Tailwind CSS CDN: Loaded directly via a CDN for easy integration without a build process.

[Deployment]

1)GitHub Pages: Utilized for free and easy static website hosting, making the application publicly accessible via a live URL.
